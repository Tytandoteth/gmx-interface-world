## 1. Project Scope

* Deploy and maintain a GMX-derived perpetual trading platform on World Chain.
* Support trading pairs: WLD, WETH, MAG.
* Provide robust, source-agnostic oracle infrastructure using CoinGecko as the primary price source with flexibility to swap to other sources in the future.
* Simplify the UI into a lightweight, performant mini-app.
* Ensure high reliability, security, and observable operations in production.

---

## 2. Repository Responsibilities

**A. Smart Contracts (`gmx-contracts-world`)**

* Core GMX components: Vault, Router, OrderBook, PositionRouter/Manager, Trackers.
* Integration with direct price feeds.
* Deployment & configuration scripts (Hardhat).

**B. Oracle Keeper (`oracle-keeper`)**

* Cloudflare Workers-based middleware providing `/prices`, `/direct-prices`, and `/health` endpoints.
* Live feeds for WLD/USD, WETH/USD, MAG/USD using CoinGecko with flexible architecture for future source changes.
* Source-agnostic implementation with clear price provider implementation.
* Diagnostic UI, health checks, retry logic.

**C. Frontend Interface (`gmx-interface-world`)**

* React/TypeScript trading UI consuming contracts and oracle service.
* EnhancedOracleKeeperFetcher with direct prices support for real-time data.
* OraclePricesProvider context for application-wide price data access.
* Reusable UI components (TokenPriceDisplay, ExchangePriceBar, etc.) for price visualization.
* Debug pages, status indicators, and mode toggle (dev/prod).
